    - white  657g 
    - wheat  140g
Note: sifted the flours into a bowl
Note: substituted rye flour in the usual recipe for wheat flour

  * Target Final Dough Temperature (FDT): 25C
    - Flour temp  22.0C
    - Room temp   22.0C
    - Levain temp 22.0C
    - *Water temp 37.6C*

Note 1: Laid levain on top of the flour and water mix; 
        laid salt and water on top;
        gently pinched and folded ingredients in, making sure I do not break the dough that has formed during autolyse; 
        did 5 big folds to shape into a rough ball.
Note 2: FDT = 27C, nice! 

4. Bulk fermentation - 12:05am 
   - room temp - 22.0
   - starter - well fed, seeming very active
   - duration 5 - 5.5hrs (expect it to end at 5:05pm - 5:35pm)
  - Did 4 stretches and folds at 30 minute intervals
  - Let it rest and ferment until 5:05pm

5. Pre-shape - 5:05pm (5hrs fermentation)
  - Did 1 set of pre-shapes and let rest uncovered for 20 mins
Note: The dough seems very nice and active, bouncy and with lots of bubbles.
Note: Did the pre-shape with veeeery little water on my fingers and scraper, it worked very well.
      Did four folds on each piece of dough and flipped them before shaping by dragging with the scraper.
      
6. Shape - 5:30pm
  - Used a lot of flour, shaping went perfectly. Used slow decisive moves.
  - Put loaves into greased and floured tins.

7. Leave in the fridge uncovered overnight - 5:45pm
   Aiming for 16hrs until 9:45am

The next day:

8. 10:45am (16hrs) - Preheat oven to 240C, with roasting tray inside.
   - The loaves have risen in the tins and are looking great

9. 11:30am - Put the loaves in, add freshly boiled water from the kettle to the roasting tin
  - Slashed the loaves before putting them in
  - Uncovered - 15 mins
  - Uncovered @ 220 - 20 mins

Notes: 
* The oven spring is good.
* Crumb is lovely and the bread is tasty.
