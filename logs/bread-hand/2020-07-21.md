Two loaves: 2 x 800g @ 67% hydration.

1. Levain
   Refreshed 2 times @12hr intervals.

2. Autolyse - 9:10am, for about an hour
  * Total flour 797g 
    - white  657g 
    - wheat  140g
Note: sifted the flours into a bowl
Note: substituted rye flour in the usual recipe for wheat flour

  * Target Final Dough Temperature (FDT): 25C
    - Flour temp  21.0C
    - Room temp   21.0C
    - Levain temp 21.0C
    - *Water temp 38.8C* 

  * Total water 642g 
    - 620g, reserving 22g for mixing

3. Mix - 10:30am
  - Flour and water mix
  - Levain      162g
  - Salt         16g
  - Water        21g
Note 1: Laid levain on top of the flour and water mix; 
        laid salt and water on top;
        gently pinched and folded ingredients in, making sure I do not break the dough that has formed during autolyse; 
        did 5 big folds to shape into a rough ball.
Note 2: FDT = 26.6C, nice! 

4. Bulk fermentation - 10:40am 
   - room temp - 21.0
   - starter - well fed, a little past its peak, but seeming very active
   - duration 6 - 6.5hrs (expect it to end at 4:40pm - 5:10pm)
  - Did 4 stretches and folds at 30 minute intervals
  - Let it rest and ferment until 5.10pm

5. Pre-shape - 5:00pm (6.25hrs fermentation)
  - Did 2 sets of pre-shape with 25 mins after each.
Note: The dough seems nice an active, maybe slightly over-proofed.
  - Did the second pre-shape with a bit too much water, the dough lost its elasticity :(
Note: Try pre-shaping with very little to no water.

6. Shape - 5:50pm
  - Used a lot of flour, shaping went well considering the slight over-proofing.
  - Put loaves into greased and floured tins.

7. Leave in the fridge uncovered overnight - 6:00pm
   Aiming for 16hrs until 10:00am

The next day:

8. 10:35am (16hrs) - Preheat oven to 240C, with roasting tray inside.
   - The loaves have a bit risen in the tins, not looking too bad.

9. 11:35am - Put the loaves in, add freshly boiled water from the kettle to the roasting tin
  - Slashed the loaves before putting them in
  - Uncovered - 15 mins
  - Uncovered @ 220 - 20 mins

Notes: 
* The oven spring is good.
* One loaf is still splitting along the one side, seam healing, need to up my shaping game.
* Crumb is fine, not as open as last week, but bread is still tasty.
