Two loaves: 2 x 800g @ 67% hydration.

1. Levain
   Refreshed 1 times 12hr before.

2. Autolyse - 10:05am, for about an hour
  * Total flour 797g 
    - white  657g 
    - wheat  140g
Note: sifted the flours into a bowl
Note: substituted rye flour in the usual recipe for wheat flour

  * Target Final Dough Temperature (FDT): 25C
    - Flour temp  21.0C
    - Room temp   21.0C
    - Levain temp 21.0C
    - *Water temp 39.7C* 

  * Total water 642g 
    - 620g, reserving 22g for mixing

3. Mix - 11:30am
  - Flour and water mix
  - Levain      162g
  - Salt         16g
  - Water        21g
Note 1: Laid levain on top of the flour and water mix; 
        laid salt and water on top;
        gently pinched and folded ingredients in, making sure I do not break the dough that has formed during autolyse; 
        did 5 big folds to shape into a rough ball.
Note 2: FDT = 26.7C, nice! 

4. Bulk fermentation - 11:35am 
   - room temp - 21.0
   - starter - well fed, a little past its peak, but seeming active
   - duration 6 - 6.5hrs (expect it to end at 5:35pm - 6:05pm)
  - Did 4 stretches and folds at 30 minute intervals, first at 12:05pm, last at 13:35pm.
  - Let it rest and ferment until 5.35pm

5. Pre-shape - 5:35pm (5:30hrs fermentation)
  - Did 2 sets of pre-shape with 25 mins after each.
Note: The dough seems nice an active.
      Pre-shapted with no flour on a slightly wet surface with a little water on my hand and scraper.
      I think that a drier surface is better for pre-shaping, water only on scraper and hand.

6. Shape - 6:30pm
  - Used a lot of flour, shaping went very well. I think both loaves seem strong.
  - Put loaves into greased and floured tins.

7. Leave in the fridge uncovered overnight - 6:45pm
   Aiming for 16hrs until 10:45am

The next day:

8. 11:00am (16.25hrs) - Preheat oven to 240C, with roasting tray inside.

9. 11:20am - Put the loaves in, add freshly boiled water from the kettle to the roasting tin
  - Slashed the loaves before putting them in
  - Uncovered - 15 mins
  - Uncovered @ 220 - 15 mins
  - Uncovered @ 220 - 5 mins

Notes: 
* The oven spring is very good, looks like the dough was well proofed and shaped.
* Slashing was alright, could have been a little firmer with it.
* Crumb is lovely - open and soft and bread is tasty.
