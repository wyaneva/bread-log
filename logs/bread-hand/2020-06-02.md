Two loaves: 2 x 800g @ 67% hydration.

1. Levain
   Refreshed 2 times at 12hr intervals.

2. Autolyse - 10:15am, for about an hour
  * Total flour 797g 
    - white  657g 
    - wheat  140g
Note: sifted the flours into a bowl
Note: substituted rye flour in the usual recipe for wheat flour

  * Target Final Dough Temperature (FDT): 25C
    - Flour temp  23.8C
    - Room temp   24.0C
    - Levain temp 23.9C
    - *Water temp 32.4C* (a bit warmer than called for)

  * Total water 642g 
    - 621g, reserving 21g for mixing

3. Mix - 11:40am
  - Flour and water mix
  - Levain      162g
  - Salt         16g
  - Water        21g
Note 1: Laid levain on top of the flour and water mix; 
        mixed salt into water and laid on top;
        gently pinched and folded ingredients in, making sure I do not break the dough that has formed during autolyse; 
        did 5 big folds to shape into a rough ball.
Note 2: FDT = 26.6C, nice! 

4. Bulk fermentation - 11:50am 
   - room temp - 24.0C
   - starter - medium well fed
   - duration 6hrs (expect it to end at 5:50pm)
  - Did 4 stretches and folds at 30 minute intervals, first at 12:20am, last at 2.05pm.
  - Did a 5th stretch and fold at 2:35pm around the four sides in order to make more of a domed shape.
  - Let it rest and ferment for another 3hrs 15mins until 5.50pm

5. Pre-shape - 6:30pm
  - Left to rest uncovered for 25 mins
Note: The dough nice, seems active with lots of bubbles!
      Pre-shapted with no flour on a watered surface with a little water on my hand and scraper.
      Used fast and desisive actions and it seems to have gone well.

6. Shape - 6:55pm
  - Used a lot of flour, shaping went well, rolled it confidently and tight.
  - Put loaves into greased and floured tins.

7. Leave in the fridge uncovered overnight - 7:10pm
   Aiming for 16hrs until 11:10am

The next day:

8. 11:10am (16hrs) - Preheat oven to 240C, with roasting tray inside.
   - The loaves have risen in the tins and spring back slowly when tested with the finger. 

9. 11:35am - Put the loaves in, add freshly boiled water from the kettle to the roasting tin
  - Slashed the loaves before putting them in, they seem strong and well proofed.
  - Uncovered - 15 mins
  - Uncovered @ 220 - 15 mins - took temperature and it was 94C,  two loaves seem to be cooking slower.
  - Uncovered @ 220 - 5 mins

Notes: 
* Great oven spring. 
* The loaf in the silicon tin has torn a little, which indicates that I should work on my shaping. Looking forward to that.
* Crumb is open and lovely, bread is tasty. Very happy.
