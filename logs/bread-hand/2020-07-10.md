Two loaves: 2 x 800g @ 67% hydration.

1. Levain
   Refreshed 1 times 12hr before.

2. Autolyse - 9:10am, for about an hour
  * Total flour 797g 
    - white  657g 
    - wheat  140g
Note: sifted the flours into a bowl
Note: substituted rye flour in the usual recipe for wheat flour

  * Target Final Dough Temperature (FDT): 25C
    - Flour temp  21.0C
    - Room temp   21.0C
    - Levain temp 21.0C
    - *Water temp 39.7C* 

  * Total water 642g 
    - 620g, reserving 22g for mixing

3. Mix - 11:00am
  - Flour and water mix
  - Levain      162g
  - Salt         16g
  - Water        21g
Note 1: Laid levain on top of the flour and water mix; 
        laid salt and water on top;
        gently pinched and folded ingredients in, making sure I do not break the dough that has formed during autolyse; 
        did 5 big folds to shape into a rough ball.
Note 2: FDT = 25.8C, nice! 

4. Bulk fermentation - 11:10am 
   - room temp - 21.0
   - starter - well fed, a little past its peak, but seeming active
   - duration 6 - 6.5hrs (expect it to end at 5:10pm - 5:40pm)
  - Did 4 stretches and folds at 30 minute intervals, first at 11:10pm, last at 12:55pm.
  - Let it rest and ferment until 5.10pm

5. Pre-shape - 5:25pm (6.25hrs fermentation)
  - Did 2 sets of pre-shape with 25 mins after each.
Note: The dough seems nice an active.
      Pre-shapted no dry surface with a little water on my hand and scraper, seems to work well.

6. Shape - 6:25pm
  - Used a lot of flour, shaping went very well. I think both loaves seem strong.
  - Put loaves into greased and floured tins.

7. Leave in the fridge uncovered overnight - 6:35pm
   Aiming for 16hrs until 10:35am

The next day:

8. 10:35am (16hrs) - Preheat oven to 240C, with roasting tray inside.
   - The loaves have not risen in the tins, especially the better pre-shaped one.

9. 11:35am - Put the loaves in, add freshly boiled water from the kettle to the roasting tin
  - Slashed the loaves before putting them in
  - Uncovered - 15 mins
  - Uncovered @ 220 - 20 mins

Notes: 
* The oven spring is good, looks like the dough was perfectly proofed.
* One loaf split along the one side - need to get better at shaping.
* Crumb is lovely -very open and soft, best one yet! :)
