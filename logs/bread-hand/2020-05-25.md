One loaf: 800g @ 67% hydration.

1. Levain
   Decided to make a bread later in the day, so I had to start the 
   levain at 3pm instead of 9am. For this reason, I used warmer water.
  The day before, 3pm:
  - Starter           12g
  - White flour        6g
  - Wheat flour        6g
  - Water @ 36C       12g
  The day before, 9pm:
  - Starter           36g
  - White flour       18g
  - Wheat flour       18g
  - Water @ 36C       36g

2. Autolyse - 10:15am, for about an hour
  * Total flour 399g 
    - white  329g 
    - wheat   70g
Note: sifted the flours into a bowl
Note: substituted rye flour in the usual recipe for wheat flour

  * Target Final Dough Temperature (FDT): 25C
    - Flour temp  19.1C
    - Room temp   20.0C
    - Levain temp 20.8C
    - *Water temp 43.3C*

  * Total water 321g 
    - 300g, reserving 21g for mixing

3. Mix - 11:30am
  - Flour and water mix
  - Levain       81g
  - Salt          8g
  - Water        21g
Note 1: Laid levain on top of the flour and water mix; 
        mixed salt into water and laid on top;
        gently pinched and folded ingredients in, making sure I do not break the dough that has formed during autolyse; 
        did 5 small folds to shape into a rough ball.
Note 2: FDT = 25.5C, nice! 

4. Bulk fermentation - 11:35am 
   (expect it to end in about 5hrs, which is at 4:35pm)
  - Wrapped the bowl in a blanket and put it next to the radiator.
  - Did 4 stretches and folds at 30 minute intervals, first at 12:05am, last at 13.50pm.
  - Letting it rest and ferment now for another 2hrs 45mins until 4.35pm

5. Pre-shape - 4:45pm
  - Left to rest uncovered for 20mins
Note: The dough is nice and active, feels strong and springy. 
      Pre-shapted with little flour - pretty stessful and sticky.
      Will preshape again with more flour.

5.1. Pre-shape 2 - 5:10pm
  - Left to rest uncovered for 25mins
Note: Covered bowl with a lot of flour and pre-shaped again.
      Went much better as my hand and scraper didn't stick and ball is holding better shape.

6. Shape - 5:35pm
  - Used a lot of flour, shaping went better than previous attempts.
  - Put it into a greased and floured tin.

7. Leave in the fridge uncovered overnight - 5:40pm
   Aiming for 16hrs until 9:40am

The next day:

8. 8:50am (~15hrs 20mins) - the loaf has risen in the tin, still springs back somewhat quickly when tested with the finger. 
   Preheat oven to 240C, with roasting tray inside.

9. Put the loaf in, add freshly boiled water from the kettle to the roasting tin - 9:10am
  - Slashed the loaf before putting it in, loaf seemed delicate and seam was closing.
  - Uncovered - 15 mins
  - Uncovered @ 220 - 15 mins

Notes: 
* Bulge on one end of bread, seam closed on the other.
* Crumb is alright, but denser on bottom and with a bulge, loaf was clearly underproofed.
* I think this was clearly due to not letting the starter rise and be active enough. Warmer water is not a substitute for adequate feeding.
