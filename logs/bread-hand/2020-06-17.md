Two loaves: 2 x 800g @ 67% hydration.

1. Levain
   Refreshed 4 times at 12hr intervals.

2. Autolyse - 9:50am, for about an hour
  * Total flour 797g 
    - white  657g 
    - wheat  140g
Note: sifted the flours into a bowl
Note: substituted rye flour in the usual recipe for wheat flour

  * Target Final Dough Temperature (FDT): 25C
    - Flour temp  21.0C
    - Room temp   21.0C
    - Levain temp 21.0C
    - *Water temp 40.5C* 

  * Total water 642g 
    - 620g, reserving 22g for mixing

3. Mix - 11:15am
  - Flour and water mix
  - Levain      162g
  - Salt         16g
  - Water        21g
Note 1: Laid levain on top of the flour and water mix; 
        mixed salt into water and laid on top;
        gently pinched and folded ingredients in, making sure I do not break the dough that has formed during autolyse; 
        did 5 big folds to shape into a rough ball.
Note 2: FDT = 26.3C, nice! 

4. Bulk fermentation - 11:20am 
   - room temp - 21.0C
   - starter - well fed, but was past its peak and seemed sleepier than before
   - duration 6-7hrs (expect it to end between 5:20pm and 6:20pm)
  - Did 4 stretches and folds at 30 minute intervals, first at 11:50am, last at 1.35pm.
  - Did a 5th stretch and fold after 30mins around the four sides in order to make more of a domed shape.
  - Let it rest and ferment until 5.50pm

5. Pre-shape - 5:30pm (6:10hrs fermentation)
  - Left to rest uncovered for 25 mins
Note: The dough has bubbles, but seems weaker than other times.
      Pre-shapted with no flour on a slightly wet surface with a little water on my hand and scraper.
      Used fast and desisive actions and it seems to have gone well.

6. Shape - 5:55pm
  - Used a lot of flour, shaping went well, rolled it confidently and tight.
  - Put loaves into greased and floured tins.

7. Leave in the fridge uncovered overnight - 6:15pm
   Aiming for 16hrs until 10:15am

The next day:

8. 10:15am (16hrs) - Preheat oven to 240C, with roasting tray inside.
   - The loaves have not risen in the tins too much

9. 10:40am - Put the loaves in, add freshly boiled water from the kettle to the roasting tin
  - Slashed the loaves before putting them in, seem to be closing a little though.
  - Uncovered - 15 mins
  - Uncovered @ 220 - 15 mins
  - Uncovered @ 220 - 5 mins

Notes: 
* I think the starter was not ideal this time, will make sure it is properly active next time.
* Shaping was difficult as the dough felt weaker than before, but my technique was more confident.
* Oven sprint is good, but slashing closed somewhat and there were a couple of tears. 
* Slashing was better this time. Felt more confident and firm with it, holding the blade like a spoon and going steadily.
* Crumb is dense - definitely under-proofed bread. Still tasty though.
