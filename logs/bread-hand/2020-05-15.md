One loaf: 800g @ 67% hydration.

1. Levain 
  The day before, 9am:
  - Starter           12g
  - White flour        7g
  - Wheat flour        7g
  - Water @ room temp 12g
  The day before, 9pm:
  - Starter           38g
  - White flour       18g
  - Wheat flour       18g
  - Water @ room temp 38g

2. Autolyse - 9:15am, for about an hour
  * Total flour 399g 
    - white  329g 
    - wheat   70g
Note: sifted the flours into a bowl
Note: we substituted rye flour in the usual recipe for wheat flour.

  * Total water 321g 
    - 300g, reserving 21g for mixing

  * Target Final Dough Temperature (FDT): 25C
    - Flour temp  19.3C
    - Room temp   19.1C
    - Levain temp 19.8C
    - *Water temp 45.0C*

3. Mix - 10:25am
  - Flour and water mix
  - Levain       81g
  - Salt          8g
  - Water        21g
Note 1: Laid levain on top of the flour and water mix; 
        mixed salt into water and laid on top;
        gently pinched and folded ingredients in, making sure I do not break the dough that has formed during autolyse; 
        did 5 small folds to shape into a rough ball.
Note 2: FDT = 25.1C, nice! 

4. Bulk fermentation - 10:30am 
   (expect it to end in about 5hrs, which is at 3:30pm)
  - Wrapped the bowl in a blanket and put it next to the radiator.
  - Did 4 stretches and folds at 30 minute intervals, first at 11:00am, last at 12.45pm.
  - Letting it rest and ferment now for another 2hrs 45mins until 3.30pm

5. Pre-shape - 3:50pm
  - Left to rest uncovered for 25mins
Note: The dough is nice and active, but still seems a little weak and is difficult to shape. Ah well!

6. Shape - 4:20pm
  - Shaped it and put it into a greased and flowered tin.

7. Leave in the fridge uncovered overnight - 4:30pm
   Aiming for 16hrs until 8:30am

The next day:

8. 9:00am (~16hrs 30mins) - the loaf has risen in the tin, still springs back somewhat quickly when tested with the finger. 
   Preheat oven to 240C, with roasting tray inside.

9. Put the loaf in, add freshly boiled water from the kettle to the roasting tin - 9:35am
  - Slashed the loaf before putting it in, seems well proofed.
  - Uncovered - 15 mins
  - Uncovered @ 220 - 15 mins - took temperature and it was 98.8C, so I took it out of the oven.

Notes: 
* Bread rose well in the tin. Looking forward to cutting it to observe the crumb.
* Crumb is mostly nice and even, but there are slight signs of under-proofing. There is a narrow dense area at the bottom and some bigger air pockets at the top.
* Next time I will bulk ferment for 6hrs.
