Two loaves: 2 x 800g @ 67% hydration.

1. Levain
   Refreshed 2 times @12hr intervals.

2. Autolyse - 11:40am, for about an hour
  * Total flour 797g 
    - white  657g 
    - wheat  140g
Note: sifted the flours into a bowl
Note: substituted rye flour in the usual recipe for wheat flour

  * Target Final Dough Temperature (FDT): 25C
    - Flour temp  22.0C
    - Room temp   22.0C
    - Levain temp 22.0C
    - *Water temp 39.5C* 

  * Total water 642g 
    - 620g, reserving 22g for mixing

3. Mix - 12:40am
  - Flour and water mix
  - Levain      162g
  - Salt         16g
  - Water        21g
Note 1: Laid levain on top of the flour and water mix; 
        laid salt and water on top;
        gently pinched and folded ingredients in, making sure I do not break the dough that has formed during autolyse; 
        did 5 big folds to shape into a rough ball.
Note 2: FDT = 25.8C

4. Bulk fermentation - 12:45am 
   - room temp - 22.0
   - starter - well fed, very active
   - duration ~6 hrs (expect it to end at 6:45pm)
Note: Did 4 sets of stretches and folds at 30 min intervals.

5. Pre-shape - 7:00pm (6hrs 15mins fermentation)
  - Did 1 pre-shape and let rest uncovered for ~20mins.
Note: The dough seems very active, bouncy and strong.
Note: Did the pre-shape with a little flour on the surface and scraper, it worked very well.
      Did four folds on each piece of dough and flipped them before shaping by dragging with the scraper.
      
6. Shape - 7:20pm
  - Used a lot of flour, shaping went fine. Used slow decisive moves.
  - Put loaves into greased and floured tins.
  - They don't look too well risen, maybe it's the lack of shape and folds.

7. Leave in the fridge uncovered overnight - 7:30pm
   Aiming for 16hrs until 11:30am

The next day:

8. 11:00am (15hrs 30mins) - Preheat oven to 240C, with roasting tray inside.
   - The loaves have risen a little in the tins.
   - Took them out to rest on the counter while oven was warming.

9. 11:35am - Put the loaves in, add freshly boiled water from the kettle to the roasting tin
  - Slashed the loaves before putting them in
  - Uncovered - 15 mins
  - Uncovered @ 220C - 20 mins

Notes: 
* The oven spring is great, loaves are huge, very happy.
* Crumb is nice, bread is tasty :)
