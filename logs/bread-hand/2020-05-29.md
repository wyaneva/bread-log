One loaf: 800g @ 67% hydration.

1. Levain
   Refreshed 4 times at 12hr intervals.

2. Autolyse - 8:50am, for about an hour
  * Total flour 399g 
    - white  329g 
    - wheat   70g
Note: sifted the flours into a bowl
Note: substituted rye flour in the usual recipe for wheat flour

  * Target Final Dough Temperature (FDT): 25C
    - Flour temp  22.8C
    - Room temp   23.0C
    - Levain temp 23.0C
    - *Water temp 33.6C*

  * Total water 321g 
    - 300g, reserving 21g for mixing

3. Mix - 10:15am (ten minutes later than usual)
  - Flour and water mix
  - Levain       81g
  - Salt          8g
  - Water        21g
Note 1: Laid levain on top of the flour and water mix; 
        mixed salt into water and laid on top;
        gently pinched and folded ingredients in, making sure I do not break the dough that has formed during autolyse; 
        did 10 small folds to shape into a rough ball.
Note 2: FDT = 26.0C, nice! 

4. Bulk fermentation - 10:25am 
   - room temp - 23.0C
   - starter - well fed
   - duration 5hrs (expect it to end at 3:25pm)
  - Did 4 stretches and folds at 30 minute intervals, first at 10:55am, last at 12.40pm.
  - Letting it rest and ferment now for another 2hrs 45mins until 3.25pm

5. Pre-shape - 3:40pm
  - Left to rest uncovered for 25 mins
Note: The dough is super nice and active, lots of bubbles!
      Pre-shapted with a lot of flour, but didn't create enough tension on top.
      Oh well, will try again next time.

6. Shape - 4:15pm
  - Used a lot of flour, shaping went well, but the dough felt gentle and bubbly. Should try to roll it tighter.
  - Put it into a greased and floured tin.

7. Leave in the fridge uncovered overnight - 4:25pm
   Aiming for 16hrs until 8:25am

The next day:

8. 8:50am (~15hrs 20mins) - the loaf has risen in the tin, still springs back somewhat quickly when tested with the finger. 
   Preheat oven to 240C, with roasting tray inside.

9. Put the loaf in, add freshly boiled water from the kettle to the roasting tin - 9:10am
  - Slashed the loaf before putting it in, seems well proofed.
  - Uncovered - 15 mins
  - Uncovered @ 220 - 15 mins - took temperature and it was 98.8C, so I took it out of the oven.

Notes: 
* Great oven spring. Looking forward to seeing the crumb.
* Crumb is open and lovely, bread is tasty. Very happy.
* Next time will practice pre-shaping.
