Two loaves: 2 x 800g @ 67% hydration.

1. Levain
   Refreshed 4 times at 12hr intervals.

2. Autolyse - 9:00am, for about an hour
  * Total flour 797g 
    - white  657g 
    - wheat  140g
Note: sifted the flours into a bowl
Note: substituted rye flour in the usual recipe for wheat flour

  * Target Final Dough Temperature (FDT): 25C
    - Flour temp  23.0C
    - Room temp   23.0C
    - Levain temp 23.0C
    - *Water temp 34.8C* 

  * Total water 642g 
    - 620g, reserving 22g for mixing

3. Mix - 10:20am
  - Flour and water mix
  - Levain      162g
  - Salt         16g
  - Water        21g
Note 1: Laid levain on top of the flour and water mix; 
        laid salt and water on top;
        gently pinched and folded ingredients in, making sure I do not break the dough that has formed during autolyse; 
        did 5 big folds to shape into a rough ball.
Note 2: FDT = 26.8C, nice! 

4. Bulk fermentation - 10:30am 
   - room temp - 23.0 - 25.0C
   - starter - well fed, a little past its peak, but seeming active
   - duration 5-6hrs (expect it to end between 3:30pm and 4:30pm)
  - Did 4 stretches and folds at 30 minute intervals, first at 11:00am, last at 12.45.
  - Did a 5th stretch and fold after 30mins around the four sides in order to make more of a domed shape.
  - Let it rest and ferment until 3.30pm

5. Pre-shape - 4:00pm (5:30hrs fermentation)
  - Left to rest uncovered for 25 mins
Note: The dough seems nice an active.
      Pre-shapted with no flour on a slightly wet surface with a little water on my hand and scraper.
      One of the loaves wasn't holding it's shape well though and was difficult to shape - could it be over-proofed?

6. Shape - 4:40pm
  - Used a lot of flour, shaping went alright considering the badly pre-shaped loaf.
  - Put loaves into greased and floured tins.

7. Leave in the fridge uncovered overnight - 4:45pm
   Aiming for 16hrs until 8:45am

The next day:

8. 8:45am (16hrs) - Preheat oven to 240C, with roasting tray inside.
   - The loaves have not risen in the tins, especially the better pre-shaped one.

9. 9:14am - Put the loaves in, add freshly boiled water from the kettle to the roasting tin
  - Slashed the loaves before putting them in
  - Uncovered - 15 mins
  - Uncovered @ 220 - 15 mins
  - Uncovered @ 220 - 5 mins

Notes: 
* The oven spring is good, looks like the dough was only a little over-proofed.
* Slashing was alright, could have been a little firmer with it.
* Crumb is lovely - open and soft and bread is tasty. Managed to save it :)
