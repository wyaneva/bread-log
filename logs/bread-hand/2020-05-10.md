One loaf: 725g @ 70% hydration.

1. Levain - the day before, 9pm:
  - Starter           50g
  - White flour       50g
  - Wheat flour       50g
  - Water @ room temp 100g

2. Autolyse - 9:55am, for about an hour
  * Total flour 355g 
    - white  293g 
    - wheat  62g
Note: we substituted rye flour in the usual recipe for wheat flour.

  * Total water 299g 
    - 287g, reserving 12g for mixing

  * Target Final Dough Temperature (FDT): 25C
    - Flour temp  21.8C
    - Room temp   18.4C
    - Levain temp 22.5C
    - *Water temp 36.12C*

3. Mix - 11:05am
  - Flour and water mix
  - Levain       72g
  - Salt          7g
  - Water        12g
Note 1: Laid ingredients on top of the flour and water mix and pinched them in.
Note 2: FDT = 25.3C, yayy! 

4. Bulk fermentation - 11:10am 
  - Wrapped the bowl in a blanket and put it next to the radiator.
  - Did 7 stretches and folds at 30 minute intervals, first at 11:40am, last at 3.20pm.
  - That should have been 4 stretches and folds, but the dough just seemed weak, so I kept going.

5. Pre-shape - 5:45pm
  - Left to rest uncovered for 25mins
Note: The dough is nice and active, but seems a bit too sticky and is not holding tension, seems pretty weak.

5.5 Pre-shape, attempt 2 - 6:15pm
  - Loaf was not holding shape as it should have, so I re-shaped it, trying to create a better skin on top.
  - Left to rest uncovered for 25mins.

6. Shape - 6:40
  - Loaf is definitely not holding shape. 
    Pre-shaped it and put it into a greased tin, hopefully it will bake better in the tin.

7. Leave in the fridge uncovered overnight.

The next day:

8. 10:30am (~16hrs) - the loaf has risen in the tin, still springs back somewhat quickly when tested with the finger. I am going to slash and bake.
   Preheat oven to 240C, with roasting tray inside.

9. Put the loaf in, add freshly boiled water from the kettle to the roasting tin - 10:55am
  - Slashed the loaf before putting it in, seems well proofed.
  - Uncovered - 15 mins
  - Uncovered @ 220 - 15 mins - took temperature and it was 98.8C, so I took it out of the oven.

Notes: 
* The bread was saved by being put in the tin. Shape is good, although tin might be a bit big.
* Next time I will try lower hydration, 65%.
