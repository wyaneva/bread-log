Two loaves: 2 x 800g @ 67% hydration.

1. Levain
   Refreshed 4 times @12hr intervals.

2. Autolyse - 10:30am, for about an hour
  * Total flour 797g 
    - white  657g 
    - wheat  140g
Note: sifted the flours into a bowl
Note: substituted rye flour in the usual recipe for wheat flour

  * Target Final Dough Temperature (FDT): 25C
    - Flour temp  20.0C
    - Room temp   20.0C
    - Levain temp 20.0C
    - *Water temp 42.2C* 

  * Total water 642g 
    - 620g, reserving 22g for mixing

3. Mix - 11:50am
  - Flour and water mix
  - Levain      162g
  - Salt         16g
  - Water        21g
Note 1: Laid levain on top of the flour and water mix; 
        laid salt and water on top;
        gently pinched and folded ingredients in, making sure I do not break the dough that has formed during autolyse; 
        did 5 big folds to shape into a rough ball.
Note 2: FDT = 25.8C

4. Bulk fermentation - 12:00am 
   - room temp - 20.0
   - starter - well fed, seeming very active
   - duration 6 hrs (expect it to end at 6pm)
Note: Did 4 sets of stretches and folds at 30 min intervals.

5. Pre-shape - 3:15pm (5hrs fermentation)
  - Did 2 sets of pre-shapes and let rest uncovered for 20 mins after each.
Note: The dough seems nice and active, bouncy. It does feel a little more fragile than other times, I guess the gluten wasn't as strong without the stretches.
Note: Did the pre-shape with very little water on my fingers and scraper, it worked very well.
      Did four folds on each piece of dough and flipped them before shaping by dragging with the scraper.
      
6. Shape - 4:00pm
  - Used a lot of flour, shaping went fine. Used slow decisive moves.
  - Put loaves into greased and floured tins.
  - They don't look too well risen, maybe it's the lack of shape and folds.

7. Leave in the fridge uncovered overnight - 4:10pm
   Aiming for 16hrs until 8:10am

The next day:

8. 8:30am (16hrs 20mins) - Preheat oven to 240C, with roasting tray inside.
   - The loaves have risen a little in the tins.

9. 9:30am - Put the loaves in, add freshly boiled water from the kettle to the roasting tin
  - Slashed the loaves before putting them in
  - Uncovered - 15 mins
  - Uncovered @ 220 - 20 mins

Notes: 
* The oven spring is good.
* The loaves a little misshapen, the dough definitely didn't feel as strong as before during shaping, which I think has lead to the current irregular shapes.
* Crumb is nice, bread is tasty :)
