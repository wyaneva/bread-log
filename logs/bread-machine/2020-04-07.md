    - white  411g 

  * Total water 266g     
    - 266g, reserve 15g for mixing 

  * Target Final Dough Temperature (FDT): 25C
    - Flour temp  18.5C
    - Room temp   18.5C
    - Levain temp 18.7C
    - *Water temp 46.5C*

Note 1: Put mix in the bread machine and laid levian, salt 
        and reserved water on top
        Set it to 'Dough' cycle
Note 2: FDT = 24.7C, measured after machine knead finished.
Note 3: Did 4 folds and stretches at ~30min intervals, first was 30mins after the kneading finished, last was at 1:15pm.
Note 4: Dough looks healthy. Will wait for ~3hrs waiting to see a smooth top and a dome forming on top.
Note 5: After 5 hours (6:15pm) the sough has a smooth top and dome.

4. Pre-shape - 7:00pm
  - Let to rest uncovered for 15mins
Note: The dough seems to hold good tension and be bubbly, definitely stronger because of the stretches and folds.

5. Shape - 7:15pm
Note: Putting it inside the bread machine basket.
Note: Leaving it to rise on the counter for ~1.5hrs
Note: Proving the loaf inside inside the fridge overnight.

The next day:

6. Take dough out of fridge - 10am
Note: There is a little rise and bubbling, looks fluffy.

7. Put in bread machine - 11am
Note: Slashed the dough with 4 long slashes.

8. End of bake cycle - 12am + 20 extra minutes
Note: This rose well in the baking stage, which is lovely.
      A bit of a tear, it would be great to br able to do deeper cuts inside the pan.
