One loaf, full sourdough: 760g total @ 68% hydration.

1. Levain - the night before - 9pm:
  - Starter            50g
  - White flour       100g
  - Water @ room temp 100g

2. Autolyse - 9:30am (for ~1hr)
  * Total flour 400g
    - white  400g 

  * Total water 280g     
    - 280g, didn't reserve any for mixing 

  * Total levain 80g     
    - 280g, could have added it to the next step as we usually do
Note: Depending on result, next time add levain in the mix stage with the salt and 15g of water

  * Target Final Dough Temperature (FDT): 25C
    - Flour temp  18.4C
    - Room temp   18.4C
    - Levain temp 20.0C
    - *Water temp 44.5C*

3. Mix and bulk fermentation in the machine - 10:45am
  - Flour and water mix
  - Salt         8g
Note 1: Put mix in the bread machine and laid salt on top
        Set it to 'Dough' cycle
Note 2: FDT = 24.9C, nice! 

4. Divide and pre-shape - 10:10pm
  - Let to rest uncovered for 15mins
Note: The dough seems to hold good tension and be bubbly, but has not risen much. 

5. Shape - 10:30pm
Note: Proving the loaf inside the bread machine basket inside the fridge.

The next day:

6. Take dough out of fridge - 10am
Note: There is a little rise, but not much. We think the starter probably wasn't vigorous enough.

7. Put in bread machine - 11am
Note: Dough was too soft to slash properly.

8. End of bake cycle - 12am + 10 extra minutes
Note: There is a spring at the cut, which is a good sign.
      Bulge on top, needs deeper slashes.
Note: Loaf wasn't completely baked, putting in the machine for 10 more minutes.

Note: Loaf is definitely underproofed - need better fed starter.
