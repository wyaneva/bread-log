One loaf, yeasted sourdough, half wholemeal: used 1 1/2 lb recipe from King Arthur Flour

0. Used refreshed dormant starter from 2020-05-03.

1. Put ingredients in following order in bread machine:
   * 5tbsp water
   * 2tbsp vegetable oil
   * 440g sourdough starter (recipe calls for 454g)
   * 144g wholemeal bread flour
   * 1.5tsp salt
   * 144g white bread flour (total bread flour - 288g, recipe calls for 298g)
   * 1.5tsp sugar
   * 2tsp dry yeast

2. Started machine on French bread cycle, 900g loaf, dark crust.

3. After 4mins, added 1tbsp water, as the dough was not incorporating all flour.

4. After both knead cycle took a look inside the machine shaped where necessary.

5. At the end of the cycle the bread was ready and I took it out.
   Height: 13cm, but the bread has sunken :(
   Crumb: small, well distributed
   Texture: soft and lovely
   Taste: lovely - subtle, but with a bit of sourdough
   Crust: lovely - thin and soft

Notes: The bread was sunken. Maybe half white, half wholemeal isn't a good combination.
