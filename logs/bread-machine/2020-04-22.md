1. Put ingredients in following order in bread machine:
   * 4tbsp water
   * 2tbsp vegetable oil
   * 444g sourdough starter (recipe calls for 454g)
   * 144g white bread flour
   * 1.5tsp salt
   * 144g white bread flour (total bread flour - 288g, recipe calls for 298g)
   * 1.5tsp sugar
   * 2tsp dry yeast

2. Started machine on French bread cycle, 700g loaf, dark crust.

3. After 3mins, added 2tbsp water, as the dough was not incorporating all flour.

4. After both knead cycle took a look inside the machine shaped where necessary.

5. At the end of the cycle the bread was a little pale, so I baked it for another 10mins.
