One loaf, yeasted sourdough: used 1lb recipe from King Arthur Flour

0. Fed starter from fridge in following schedule to end up with 300g needed for recipe:
   * Day -4;am:    5g:5g:5g          (24hrs, but should have been 12hrs)
   * Day -3;am:    15g:15g:15g       (24hrs, but should have been 12hrs)
   * Day -2;am:    45g:45g:45g       (12hrs)
   * Day -2;pm:    50g:50g:50g       (12hrs, discarded 85g)
   * Day -1;am:    50g:50g:50g       (12hrs, discarded 100gr)
   * Day -1;pm:    100g:100g:100g    (12hrs, put 50g back in jar in fridge)

Note: Could definitely have fed the starter only 3 days and probably even 2 days without discarding too much, as it was very active. Could consider starting with 15g or even 50g of starter if I want to bake much faster.

1. Put ingredients in following order in bread machine:
   * 3tbsp water
   * 1tbsp vegetable oil
   * 290g sourdough starter (recipe calls for 300g)
   * 95g white bread flour
   * 1tsp salt
   * 95g white bread flour (total bread flour - 190g, recipe calls for 198g)
   * 1tsp sugar
   * 1tsp dry yeast

2. Started machine on French bread cycle, 700g loaf, dark crust.

3. After 5mins, added 1.5tbsp water (dough was not incorporating all flour).

4. After both knead cycle took a look inside the machine shaped where necessary.

5. At the end of the cycle the bread was ready.
   Height: 9.5cm
