Refreshing dormant starter

General notes:
1. Feeding starter with flour in 1:2 ratio 
   probably leads to the starter taking 
   long to eat through the flour (36hrs in this case).
2. This ratio uses a lot of flour.
3. Next time try feeding 1:1 ratio (50g each) and observe 
   how long it takes for activity to start. 
4. Do the following: feed, wait for activity, feed until
   activity seems healthy and takes 10-12hrs to achieve.
5. Once activity seems healthy, feed again for baking
   and put the reminder in the fridge.
6. Keeping the sourdough in the fridge gives it the sour taste;
   this is why it is good to do proof the shaped loaves in the fridge 
   overnight before baking.

Note: Below schedule resulted in underproved loaf.
